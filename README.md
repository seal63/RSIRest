# RSIRest

This is an android application for managing rests to combat sedentarism. When you press the button (Start podometer) the app will start working and every 25 minutes you will be prompted to walk for 50 steps. This makes it a lot easier to take care of yourself, specially if you spend a large part of your day sitting in a chair.
